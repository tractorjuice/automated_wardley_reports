Paragraphs:
Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems. It involves the design and optimization of prompts to elicit the most accurate and relevant responses from language models. As AI continues to evolve, the role of prompt engineering becomes increasingly significant, influencing the performance and reliability of AI-driven applications. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering, its importance, and how it fits into the broader landscape of AI and ML.

Wardley Mapping is a strategic tool used to visualize the components of a system and their evolution over time. Named after its creator, Simon Wardley, this mapping technique helps organizations understand their environment, identify opportunities, and make informed decisions. By categorizing components into stages of evolution—genesis, custom-built, product, and commodity—Wardley Maps provide a clear picture of where each component stands and how it is likely to evolve. This chapter will introduce the concept of Wardley Mapping and explain its relevance to prompt engineering.
