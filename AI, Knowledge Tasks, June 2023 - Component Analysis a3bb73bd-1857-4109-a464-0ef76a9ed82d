Outline: 1. Introduction to the Wardley Map
   - Overview of the Wardley Map
   - Explanation of the evolution stages
   - Importance of visibility and positioning
Paragraphs:
The Wardley Map titled "AI, Knowledge Tasks, June 2023" provides a comprehensive visualization of various components involved in AI and knowledge tasks. This map is structured to show the evolution of each component from genesis to commodity, highlighting their current state and visibility. The map is divided into four main stages of evolution: genesis/concept, custom/emerging, product/converging, and commodity/accepted. Each component is positioned based on its current evolutionary stage and its visibility to the users.

The evolution stages in the Wardley Map are crucial for understanding the maturity and adoption of each component. Components in the genesis stage are in their infancy, often experimental and not widely adopted. As they move to the custom/emerging stage, they become more defined and start gaining traction. In the product/converging stage, components are standardized and widely used, while in the commodity/accepted stage, they are fully mature and ubiquitous. This progression helps stakeholders identify where to focus their efforts for innovation and improvement.
