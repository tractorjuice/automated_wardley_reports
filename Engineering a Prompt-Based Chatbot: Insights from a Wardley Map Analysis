    B. Overview of the Wardley Map
    C. Purpose of the Strategy Report
Paragraphs:
Prompt-Based Chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years, with more businesses adopting them to improve customer engagement and service. These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. One of the key components of a Prompt-Based Chatbot is the prompt engineering process, which involves designing and optimizing prompts that are used to generate responses. In this strategy report, we will explore the insights and recommendations derived from analyzing a Wardley Map of the Prompt-Based Chatbot ecosystem.

The Wardley Map is a strategic planning tool that helps organizations visualize the evolution of their products and services. It consists of a value chain that maps the components of a system, from genesis to commodity. The map is divided into four stages: Genesis, Custom/Emerging, Product/Converging, and Commodity/Accepted. The Wardley Map provides insights into the evolution of a product or service, allowing organizations to make informed decisions about where to invest their resources.
