The Wardley Map titled "AI, Knowledge Tasks, June 2023" provides a comprehensive visualization of various components involved in AI and knowledge tasks. The map is structured around the concept of evolution, which is divided into four stages: genesis/concept, custom/emerging, product/converging, and commodity/accepted. Each component is placed on the map based on its current stage of evolution and its visibility. This mapping technique helps in understanding the maturity and market acceptance of different elements within the AI ecosystem.

The map includes a diverse range of components, each with a specific role in the AI and knowledge tasks landscape. Key components such as "USERS," "Citizens," "Gov," "Enterprises," and "SME" are positioned in the product stage with high visibility, indicating their established presence and importance. Other components like "TRUST," "PRACTICE," and "KNOWLEDGE TASKS" are also highlighted, showcasing their critical roles in the ecosystem. The map also features foundational elements like "FOUNDATIONAL MODEL," "COMPUTE," and "STORAGE," which are essential for the functioning of higher-level components.

The evolution of components from genesis to commodity is a crucial aspect of the Wardley Map. For instance, "creating" is in the genesis stage, indicating it is still in the early phases of development and innovation. This stage is characterized by high levels of uncertainty and experimentation, where new ideas are being tested and refined. As these components mature, they move into the custom/emerging stage, where they begin to gain traction and see early adoption. This stage involves significant customization and adaptation to meet specific needs and requirements. On the other hand, components like "summarizing," "recommending," and "analyzing" are in the commodity stage, signifying their widespread acceptance and standardization. These components have become essential tools in the AI and knowledge tasks ecosystem, providing reliable and efficient solutions that are widely used across various industries. The map also highlights the interconnectedness of these components through various links, illustrating how they interact and depend on each other to create a cohesive AI and knowledge tasks ecosystem. For example, the effectiveness of "analyzing" is often dependent on the quality of data provided by "creating" and "summarizing." Similarly, "recommending" relies on insights generated by "analyzing" to provide relevant suggestions. This interconnectedness underscores the importance of a well-integrated ecosystem where each component plays a vital role in supporting the others. The Wardley Map thus provides a valuable framework for understanding the dynamic and evolving nature of the AI and knowledge tasks landscape, helping stakeholders identify key areas for investment and development.
