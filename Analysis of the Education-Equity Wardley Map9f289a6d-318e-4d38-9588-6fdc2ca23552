Paragraphs:
Wardley Maps are a strategic planning tool used to visualise the components of a business, industry, or ecosystem, and how they evolve over time. The Education-Equity Wardley Map provides an overview of the education industry and its stakeholders, including governments, educational institutions, financial institutions, customers, consumers, NGOs, and social actors. The map also shows the evolution of each component, from genesis to custom, product, and commodity. This report will analyse the components of the Education-Equity Wardley Map, provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis, and offer guidance for potential improvements or adjustments to the map.

The Education-Equity Wardley Map consists of 26 components, each with its own name, description, evolution, visibility, position, and label position. The components can be categorised into several groups, including agenda, resources, outcome, social class, business, literacy, power, expand, money, data, infrastructure, inclusion, exclusion, physical, virtual, knowledge, skill, job, profit, Mooc, hybrid, academic standards, scholarship, intelligence traits theory, and school management tools. Each component plays a crucial role in the education industry and its evolution, and understanding their relationships and evolution is essential for developing effective strategies.
