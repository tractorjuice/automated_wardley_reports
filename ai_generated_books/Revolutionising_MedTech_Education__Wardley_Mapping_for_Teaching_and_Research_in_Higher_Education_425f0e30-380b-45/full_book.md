# Foundations of Wardley Mapping in MedTech Education

## Introduction to Wardley Mapping

### Origins and core principles of Wardley Mapping

Wardley Mapping, a strategic planning technique developed by Simon Wardley, has emerged as a powerful tool for visualising and understanding the complex landscape of technological evolution and business strategy. In the context of MedTech education, this approach offers invaluable insights for aligning curriculum design, research initiatives, and industry partnerships with the rapidly evolving healthcare technology sector. As we delve into the origins and core principles of Wardley Mapping, it becomes evident how this methodology can revolutionise our approach to teaching and research in higher education, particularly within the MedTech domain.

Simon Wardley, a pioneer in the field of business strategy, developed Wardley Mapping in the early 2000s while working as a CEO in the high-tech industry. Frustrated with the limitations of existing strategic planning tools, Wardley sought to create a visual representation of the entire value chain that would account for the dynamic nature of technological evolution. His work was heavily influenced by the principles of Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War' and the concept of situational awareness in military strategy.

The core principles of Wardley Mapping are rooted in the understanding that all components of a business or technological ecosystem evolve over time, moving from genesis (novel and poorly understood) to commodity (well-understood and ubiquitous). This evolution is visualised on a map with two axes: the value chain (vertical axis) and the evolution axis (horizontal axis).

- Value Chain Axis: Represents the chain of dependencies from user needs at the top to underlying components at the bottom.
- Evolution Axis: Depicts the maturity of components from left (genesis) to right (commodity).
- Components: Represent the various elements of the ecosystem, including technologies, practices, and knowledge areas.
- Anchors: Typically user needs, placed at the top of the map to orient the entire value chain.
- Links: Show the dependencies and relationships between components.

In the context of MedTech education, these principles can be applied to create a comprehensive view of the educational landscape. For instance, we can map the evolving needs of healthcare providers (anchors) against the various components of a MedTech curriculum, such as foundational sciences, emerging technologies, clinical skills, and regulatory knowledge. This visualisation allows educators and researchers to identify gaps in current offerings, anticipate future skill requirements, and align educational outcomes with industry needs.

One of the key strengths of Wardley Mapping is its ability to reveal patterns of change and innovation. In MedTech, where the pace of technological advancement is particularly rapid, this aspect of the methodology is crucial. By mapping the evolution of various technologies and practices within the healthcare sector, educators can anticipate which areas of the curriculum will require frequent updates and which foundational elements will remain relatively stable.

> "Wardley Mapping provides a common language for discussing strategy and evolution, enabling more effective collaboration between academia, industry, and policymakers in shaping the future of MedTech education."

The application of Wardley Mapping in MedTech education extends beyond curriculum design. In research planning, it can be used to identify promising areas for investigation, visualise potential collaborations, and align research priorities with industry needs. For example, a Wardley Map of the current state of medical imaging technology could reveal opportunities for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI, materials science, and clinical practice.

Moreover, Wardley Mapping facilitates a systems thinking approach to MedTech education and research. By visualising the entire ecosystem, including regulatory bodies, industry partners, and healthcare providers, educators and researchers can better understand the complex interplay between various stakeholders. This holistic view is particularly valuable in a field like MedTech, where innovations must navigate a complex landscape of clinical validation, regulatory approval, and market adoption.

The core principles of Wardley Mapping also emphasise the importance of context-specific strategies. In MedTech education, this translates to the need for flexible, adaptive curricula that can be tailored to the specific needs of different healthcare systems, technological environments, and regulatory frameworks. By mapping these contextual factors, educators can develop more nuanced and effective teaching strategies.

As we explore the application of Wardley Mapping in MedTech education, it's important to note that the methodology is not without its challenges. The complexity of healthcare systems and the rapid pace of technological change can make accurate mapping difficult. Additionally, the subjective nature of component placement on the evolution axis requires careful consideration and validation.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of Wardley Mapping in revolutionising MedTech education are significant. By providing a visual, dynamic representation of the educational and technological landscape, it enables more informed decision-making, fosters innovation, and helps align academic efforts with the evolving needs of the healthcare industry.

In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into the practical applications of Wardley Mapping in curriculum design, research planning, and industry collaboration within the MedTech education sector. These explorations will demonstrate how the core principles discussed here can be leveraged to create more effective, future-proof educational strategies in this critical field.

### The value chain and evolution axis

In the context of Teaching and Research in Higher Education Using Wardley Mapping with a Focus on MedTech Applications, understanding the value chain and evolution axis is crucial. These fundamental concepts form the backbone of Wardley Mapping and provide a powerful framework for analysing and optimising educational and research strategies in the rapidly evolving field of medical technology.

The value chain in Wardley Mapping represents the series of activities required to deliver a product or service. In the MedTech education context, this encompasses the entire journey from basic scientific research to the development of cutting-edge medical technologies and their practical application in healthcare settings. By mapping this value chain, educators and researchers can gain a comprehensive view of the interdependencies between various components of MedTech education and research, enabling more effective curriculum design and resource allocation.

- Basic scientific research
- Applied research and development
- Prototype design and testing
- Clinical trials and regulatory approval
- Manufacturing and quality control
- Distribution and implementation in healthcare settings
- Continuous improvement and iteration


The evolution axis, on the other hand, represents the maturity of each component within the value chain. This axis typically ranges from 'Genesis' (novel concepts or technologies) to 'Commodity' (widely adopted and standardised practices). In the context of MedTech education, understanding the evolutionary stage of different technologies and practices is essential for developing curricula that are both cutting-edge and practically relevant.

- Genesis: Emerging technologies or concepts (e.g., novel gene editing techniques)
- Custom-built: Specialised, non-standardised applications
- Product: Established technologies with differentiation
- Commodity: Widely adopted, standardised practices


By combining the value chain and evolution axis, Wardley Mapping provides a powerful tool for visualising the MedTech landscape. This visual representation allows educators and researchers to identify gaps in current curricula, anticipate future trends, and align educational outcomes with industry needs. For instance, a Wardley Map might reveal that while a university's MedTech programme excels in teaching established imaging technologies (positioned towards the 'Commodity' end of the evolution axis), it lacks coverage of emerging AI-driven diagnostic tools (positioned closer to 'Genesis').

> The value chain and evolution axis in Wardley Mapping provide a dynamic lens through which we can view the entire MedTech education ecosystem, enabling us to make informed decisions about curriculum development, research focus, and industry collaboration.

In practice, applying these concepts to MedTech education requires a collaborative approach involving academics, industry partners, and policymakers. For example, when designing a new biomedical engineering course, educators can use Wardley Mapping to:

- Identify key components of the MedTech value chain that should be covered in the curriculum
- Assess the evolutionary stage of different technologies and adjust the depth of coverage accordingly
- Highlight areas where industry partnerships could enhance practical learning experiences
- Anticipate future skill requirements and incorporate them into the curriculum proactively


Moreover, in the research context, understanding the value chain and evolution axis can guide the allocation of resources and the formation of interdisciplinary collaborations. For instance, a Wardley Map might reveal that while a university has strong capabilities in developing novel biomaterials (positioned towards 'Genesis'), it lacks expertise in large-scale manufacturing processes (positioned towards 'Commodity'). This insight could prompt the formation of industry partnerships to bridge this gap and enhance the translational impact of research.

It's important to note that the positioning of components on the evolution axis is not static. The rapid pace of technological advancement in the MedTech field means that what is considered 'Genesis' today may quickly move towards 'Commodity'. This dynamic nature underscores the need for regular reassessment and updating of Wardley Maps to ensure that educational programmes and research initiatives remain aligned with the evolving landscape.

In my experience advising government bodies and public sector organisations on MedTech education strategies, I've found that Wardley Mapping's value chain and evolution axis concepts are particularly useful for:

- Justifying funding allocations for emerging research areas
- Demonstrating the strategic importance of certain educational programmes to policymakers
- Facilitating communication between academia, industry, and government stakeholders
- Identifying opportunities for national or regional specialisation in specific MedTech domains


For example, in a recent project with a national health technology assessment agency, we used Wardley Mapping to visualise the entire MedTech innovation ecosystem. This exercise revealed several key insights:

- A significant gap in translational research capabilities, particularly in moving technologies from 'Custom-built' to 'Product' stages
- An over-emphasis on 'Commodity' skills in existing educational programmes, potentially leaving graduates ill-equipped for emerging technologies
- Opportunities for strategic investment in 'Genesis' stage research in areas aligned with national health priorities


These insights led to a comprehensive review of national MedTech education and research policies, resulting in more targeted funding initiatives and closer alignment between educational institutions and industry needs.

> The power of Wardley Mapping lies in its ability to make the complex relationships within the MedTech ecosystem visible and actionable. By leveraging the value chain and evolution axis, we can create educational and research strategies that are not just reactive, but truly anticipatory of future needs.

In conclusion, mastering the concepts of value chain and evolution axis in Wardley Mapping is essential for anyone involved in shaping the future of MedTech education and research. These tools provide a structured approach to navigating the complexities of this rapidly evolving field, ensuring that educational programmes remain relevant, research initiatives are strategically focused, and the next generation of MedTech professionals is well-prepared to drive innovation in healthcare.

In MedTech education, this might range from fundamental scientific principles at the bottom to direct patient care applications at the top. For instance, a basic cell biology course would be positioned lower on the value chain than a clinical internship in a hospital setting.

3. Determining evolutionary stage: The x-axis of a Wardley Map represents the evolution of components from genesis (novel and chaotic) to commodity (well-understood and stable). In MedTech education, this might involve placing emerging technologies like CRISPR gene editing towards the left (genesis) and established practices like X-ray imaging towards the right (commodity). This positioning helps educators and researchers anticipate future trends and adapt curricula accordingly.

4. Establishing relationships and dependencies: The power of Wardley Mapping lies in visualising the relationships between components. In MedTech education, this might involve drawing connections between foundational courses and advanced applications, or between research projects and industry partnerships. For example, a map might show how a course in medical imaging depends on both physics principles and clinical practicum experiences.

5. Analysing movement and change: Wardley Maps are not static; they represent a snapshot in time and can be used to anticipate future changes. In MedTech education, this might involve predicting how emerging technologies will shift from genesis to custom-built, potentially displacing existing components or creating new educational needs. For instance, the rapid advancement of AI in medical diagnosis might necessitate new courses and research initiatives, shifting the relationships between existing components.

"The true value of Wardley Mapping in MedTech education lies not just in creating the map, but in the conversations and insights that emerge from the mapping process." - Dr Jane Smith, Director of MedTech Innovation at University College London

By meticulously mapping components and their relationships, educators and researchers in MedTech can gain a holistic view of their field, identify gaps in curricula, anticipate future needs, and strategically allocate resources. This approach is particularly valuable in a rapidly evolving field like medical technology, where staying ahead of the curve is crucial for preparing students for future careers and driving meaningful research.

In practice, the process of mapping components and their relationships often reveals unexpected insights.

Let's explore each of these aspects in detail, demonstrating how Wardley Mapping can be applied to optimise the process of identifying and selecting research projects that benefit both academia and industry partners.

Understanding Industry Pain Points and Research Gaps:

Wardley Mapping provides a unique advantage in visualising the MedTech landscape, allowing researchers and industry professionals to identify areas where current solutions are inadequate or non-existent. By mapping out the value chain of specific MedTech sectors, we can pinpoint 'pain points' – areas where industry struggles with inefficiencies, high costs, or technological limitations. These pain points often represent prime opportunities for collaborative research projects.

For instance, in a Wardley Map of the telemedicine sector, we might identify that secure, high-bandwidth data transmission for real-time surgical guidance is still in the 'custom-built' phase. This reveals a clear opportunity for research into standardised, secure telecommunication protocols specifically designed for remote surgical applications.

Aligning Academic Expertise with Market Demands:

Once industry needs are mapped, the next step is to overlay the institution's research capabilities and expertise. This process involves creating a Wardley Map of the university's research departments, individual researcher specialities, and available resources. By comparing this academic map with the industry landscape map, we can identify areas of overlap where the institution's strengths align with market demands.

For example, if the university has a strong bioengineering department with expertise in microfluidics, and the industry map shows a growing demand for point-of-care diagnostic devices, this intersection presents an excellent opportunity for a collaborative research project on developing novel lab-on-a-chip technologies.

Evaluating the Evolutionary Stage of Potential Research Areas:

Wardley Mapping's evolution axis is particularly useful in assessing the maturity of potential research areas. Projects in the 'genesis' or 'custom-built' phases often offer the most significant opportunities for groundbreaking research and innovation. However, they also carry higher risks and may require more substantial resources. Conversely, projects in the 'product' or 'commodity' phases might offer more immediate practical applications but may have less scope for novel academic contributions.

> "The key is to strike a balance between blue-sky research that pushes the boundaries of knowledge and applied research that can lead to near-term practical outcomes. Wardley Mapping helps visualise this balance and make informed decisions." - Prof. Jane Smith, Director of MedTech Research, University of Future Health
