Affiliate partnerships are another effective strategy in influencer marketing. Companies provide influencers with unique referral links or discount codes that they can share with their audience. When a follower makes a purchase using the influencer's link or code, the influencer receives a commission or other incentives. This not only drives visibility but also incentivizes influencers to actively promote the company's products or services. Affiliate partnerships create a win-win situation, where both the company and the influencer benefit from increased visibility and revenue.

Brand ambassador programs are a long-term collaboration between companies and influencers. In this arrangement, influencers become the face of the brand and actively promote its products or services over an extended period.
