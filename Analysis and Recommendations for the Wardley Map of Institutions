Paragraphs:
The Wardley Map of Institutions provides a visual representation of the evolution of different components of institutions, including supranational government, government, collective, society, corporation, people, legitimacy, trust, benevolence, integrity, competency, sovereignty, territorial, economic, cultural, political, technological, social, success, values, landscapes, awareness, territory, supply chain, and behaviour. This map allows us to identify the relationships and dependencies between these components and to make informed decisions about how to improve and adapt institutions in response to changing circumstances.

One of the key insights we can draw from this map is the importance of trust and legitimacy in institutions. These components are central to the functioning of government and collective action, and they are closely linked to the success of institutions in achieving their goals. We can also see the importance of competency and capability in enabling institutions to adapt and respond to changing circumstances, and the role of values in shaping the priorities and direction of institutions.
