Paragraphs:
The game development industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing popularity of video games and the emergence of new technologies. In order to create successful games, developers rely on a robust infrastructure that supports the entire game development process. The Wardley Map titled "Game Development & Infrastructure" provides a visual representation of the key components and relationships within this industry. It highlights the needs, capabilities, and interactions of various stakeholders, including gamers, modders, indie game studios, established game studios, and tech companies.

One of the key insights derived from the Wardley Map is the importance of passion and meaning in game development. Indie game studios, in particular, prioritize creating games that align with their creative vision and provide a sense of purpose. On the other hand, established game studios and tech companies focus on generating profit and leveraging their intellectual property. This distinction in priorities highlights the diverse motivations within the industry and the need for a balance between passion and profitability.
