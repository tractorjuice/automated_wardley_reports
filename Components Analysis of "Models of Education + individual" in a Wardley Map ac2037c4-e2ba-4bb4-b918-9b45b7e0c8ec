III. Analysis of the Components in the Wardley Map
Paragraphs:
The "Models of Education + individual" Wardley Map is a visual representation of the various components that make up the education system. The map includes four anchors: government, business, student, and teachers. The evolution axis of the map ranges from commodity to custom, while the visibility axis ranges from low to high. The components in the map include policy, behaviors, competence, experience, learning, cognitive ability, notion of intelligence, motivation, outcome, influencers, mentorship, values/beliefs, diversity approach, progression, assessment, learning habitat, teaching practices, conveyor belt, stream model, theories of learning, access, infrastructure, physical, digital, content, and media.

The components in the Wardley Map are interconnected through links, which represent the relationships between the components. For instance, the link between government and behaviors indicates that the government has a role to play in shaping the behaviors of students. Similarly, the link between learning and experience shows that learning is an essential component of the experience that students gain from the education system. The map also includes pipelines, which represent the potential markets that can be created from the components. The pipelines in the map include motivation, outcome, influencer, values/belief, diversity approach, progression, assessment, learning habitat, teaching practices, theories of learning, access, infrastructure, content, and media.

Regulatory changes are not the only external factors that can impact the evolution and positioning of the components in the Education-Equity Wardley Map. Technological advancements also play a significant role in shaping the education system. For instance, the emergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual reality has the potential to disrupt the education system by providing new ways of delivering education. These advancements can impact the positioning of the components related to emerging and custom components, such as online learning platforms and educational apps. Companies need to stay up-to-date with these advancements and leverage them to develop innovative features and functionalities that meet the changing needs of the education system.

In addition to regulatory changes and technological advancements, changes in user behavior and preferences can also impact the evolution and positioning of the components in the Education-Equity Wardley Map. For instance, the increasing popularity of mobile devices and social media platforms has changed the way students access and consume educational content. Companies need to adapt their strategies to meet the changing needs and preferences of their users to stay competitive. Moreover, changes in the demographic profile of students, such as an aging population or an increase in international students, can also impact the positioning of the components. Companies need to monitor these changes and adapt their strategies accordingly to stay relevant and meet the changing needs of their users.

Furthermore, the Education-Equity Wardley Map highlights the importance of collaboration and partnership among components in the same control layer or closely positioned on the map. Collaboration and partnership can provide benefits in adapting to potential regulatory changes, technological advancements, and changes in user behavior and preferences. For instance, components related to content creation and curation, such as the learning management system and the assessment tool, may benefit from collaboration and partnership to improve the quality and relevance of the content. Companies need to identify potential partners and develop strategies to collaborate with them to stay competitive.
