Outline: I. Introduction of the Wardley Map
II. Description of the Components in the Wardley Map
III. Analysis of the Components in the Wardley Map
Paragraphs:
The "Models of Education + individual" Wardley Map is a visual representation of the various components that make up the education system. The map includes four anchors: government, business, student, and teachers. The evolution axis of the map ranges from commodity to custom, while the visibility axis ranges from low to high. The components in the map include policy, behaviors, competence, experience, learning, cognitive ability, notion of intelligence, motivation, outcome, influencers, mentorship, values/beliefs, diversity approach, progression, assessment, learning habitat, teaching practices, conveyor belt, stream model, theories of learning, access, infrastructure, physical, digital, content, and media.

The components in the Wardley Map are interconnected through links, which represent the relationships between the components. For instance, the link between government and behaviors indicates that the government has a role to play in shaping the behaviors of students. Similarly, the link between learning and experience shows that learning is an essential component of the experience that students gain from the education system. The map also includes pipelines, which represent the potential markets that can be created from the components. The pipelines in the map include motivation, outcome, influencer, values/belief, diversity approach, progression, assessment, learning habitat, teaching practices, theories of learning, access, infrastructure, content, and media.
