The Wardley Map Foundation Brand Based Business Model revolves around the concept of leveraging a brand to generate revenue and create a sustainable ecosystem. The foundation acts as the central entity, owning the brand and providing services to its members. Commercial vendors can join the foundation and use the brand by paying an annual fee. On the other hand, free tools and individuals can use the brand without any cost. The revenue generated from these sources is then used to support the foundation and its activities. Additionally, the foundation collaborates with Mapping Consultants, Mapping Trainers, and Mapping Books to generate revenue through their services.
