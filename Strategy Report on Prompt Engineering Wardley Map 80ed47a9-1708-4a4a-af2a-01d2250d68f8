Paragraphs:
Prompt Engineering is a field that involves the development of conversational agents, chatbots, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. With the growth of AI and machine learning, the demand for conversational agents has increased, and Prompt Engineering has become a crucial field. This strategy report will analyze the Wardley Map for Prompt Engineering and offer insights and recommendations based on its components.

The Wardley Map is a tool for visualizing the evolution of components in a system, from genesis to commodity. It consists of a value chain, with components placed according to their level of evolution and their impact on the system. The Wardley Map for Prompt Engineering includes components such as techniques, chunks, embedding, agents, LLMs, cloud, and many more. By analyzing the map, we can gain insights into the evolution of the components and their impact on the system.
