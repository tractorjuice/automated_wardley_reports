The Wardley Map titled "AI, Knowledge Tasks, June 2023" serves as a comprehensive visual representation of the various components involved in the domain of artificial intelligence and knowledge tasks. This map, created by a collaborative effort of experts including Kurt Sterzl, Xavier de Lecaros-Aquise, Bill Murray, Josh Schairbaum, and Arttu Laitinen, and modified by Simon Wardley, provides a detailed overview of the landscape. The map is structured to show the evolution of components from their genesis or conceptual stage, through custom and emerging phases, to product and converging stages, and finally to commodity and accepted stages. This evolutionary perspective is crucial for understanding how different elements interact and mature over time.

The map is divided into several key areas, each representing different aspects of AI and knowledge tasks. These areas include users, needs, knowledge tasks, interfaces, applied models, foundational models, MLOps, training data, model training, compute, and storage. Each component within these areas is positioned based on its current stage of evolution and its relationship with other components. For instance, users such as citizens, government, enterprises, SMEs, and researchers are positioned towards the commodity end, indicating their established and accepted role in the ecosystem. On the other hand, foundational models like multimodal, LLM, neural networks, and classical (Markov) models are placed towards the genesis and custom stages, highlighting their ongoing development and refinement.

Understanding the flow of dependencies and interactions between these components is essential for strategic planning. The map illustrates various pipelines and flows, such as the flow from JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) to practice, from practice to knowledge tasks, and from knowledge tasks to applied models. These flows indicate the progression and transformation of tasks and models as they move through different stages of evolution. For example, the flow from knowledge tasks to the interface suggests the integration of AI capabilities into user-facing applications. Similarly, the flow from applied models to foundational models underscores the reliance on foundational technologies to build and refine applied AI solutions. By analyzing these flows, organizations can identify critical dependencies and potential bottlenecks in their AI strategy. 

Moreover, the map highlights the importance of understanding the maturity of each component. Components in the genesis or custom stages are often experimental and require significant investment in research and development.
