Title: Strategic Analysis of AI Knowledge Tasks - June 2023
Outline: The first chapter will provide an introduction to the Wardley Map titled "AI, Knowledge Tasks, June 2023." It will cover the background of the map, the contributors involved, and the overall structure of the map. The chapter will also explain the importance of understanding the evolution of components from genesis to commodity and how this impacts strategic decision-making.
Paragraphs:
The Wardley Map titled "AI, Knowledge Tasks, June 2023" serves as a comprehensive visual representation of the various components involved in the domain of artificial intelligence and knowledge tasks. This map, created by a collaborative effort of experts including Kurt Sterzl, Xavier de Lecaros-Aquise, Bill Murray, Josh Schairbaum, and Arttu Laitinen, and modified by Simon Wardley, provides a detailed overview of the landscape. The map is structured to show the evolution of components from their genesis or conceptual stage, through custom and emerging phases, to product and converging stages, and finally to commodity and accepted stages. This evolutionary perspective is crucial for understanding how different elements interact and mature over time.

The map is divided into several key areas, each representing different aspects of AI and knowledge tasks. These areas include users, needs, knowledge tasks, interfaces, applied models, foundational models, MLOps, training data, model training, compute, and storage. Each component within these areas is positioned based on its current stage of evolution and its relationship with other components. For instance, users such as citizens, government, enterprises, SMEs, and researchers are positioned towards the commodity end, indicating their established and accepted role in the ecosystem. On the other hand, foundational models like multimodal, LLM, neural networks, and classical (Markov) models are placed towards the genesis and custom stages, highlighting their ongoing development and refinement.
