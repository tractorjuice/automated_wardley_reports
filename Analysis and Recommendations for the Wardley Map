Paragraphs:
The Wardley Map is a tool used to visualize the evolution of a business strategy. It consists of a set of interconnected components that represent the various stages of development of a product or service. In this particular map, we see two main components, the tribe and the hunter, which are linked together. The hunter is linked to Need0, indicating that it is responsible for fulfilling this need.

The tribe component is located at the top left corner of the map, and it is connected to the hunter component, which is located slightly to the right and below it. The tribe represents the group of people who are responsible for creating and maintaining the product or service, while the hunter represents the team responsible for delivering the product or service to the customers. The fact that the hunter is linked to Need0 indicates that this is a critical need that the team is working to fulfill.
