Paragraphs:
In recent years, the importance of cybersecurity has become increasingly evident as organizations face a growing number of threats and attacks. One crucial aspect of cybersecurity is security awareness, which refers to the knowledge and understanding of potential risks and the adoption of best practices to mitigate them. This strategy report aims to analyze the current state of security awareness and provide recommendations for its improvement. The Wardley Map presented here offers a visual representation of the components and their relationships, allowing us to gain valuable insights into the cybersecurity landscape.

The evolution of security awareness can be observed through the lens of the Wardley Map. Initially, it was a concept that emerged as organizations recognized the need to educate their employees and stakeholders about cybersecurity risks. Over time, security awareness has evolved into a custom practice, with organizations developing their own approaches and metrics to measure its effectiveness. As the demand for security awareness grew, it transitioned into a product, with standardized training programs and tools becoming available. Today, security awareness has reached the stage of a commodity, where it is widely accepted as a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity.
