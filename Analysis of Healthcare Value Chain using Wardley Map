The Wardley Map is a strategic tool that helps in analyzing the value chain of any industry. It provides a visual representation of the components of the value chain, their evolution, and their interdependencies. The map is divided into four categories, namely genesis, custom, product, and commodity. The categories represent the different stages of evolution of a component in the value chain, from an emerging concept to an accepted commodity.
